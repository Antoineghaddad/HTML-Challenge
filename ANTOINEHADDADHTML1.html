  <p> <i><u>GitHub</u> is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform <br>for software developers.
       Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to <br>GitHub, initiated an acquisition GitHub for 
       $7.5 billion in June, 2018. GitHub,<br> which is delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
       business model, <br>was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an open source code management <br>
       system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.</i></p>

       <p>Because GitHub is so intuitive to use and its version-control tools are so useful<br>
         for collaboration, nonprogrammers have also begun to use GitHub to work on document-based<br> and multimedia projects. GitLab is an open source alternative to GitHub.</p>
